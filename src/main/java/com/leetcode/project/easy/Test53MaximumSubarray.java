public class Test53MaximumSubarray {
    /*
    Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number)
    which has the largest sum and return its sum.

    Example:
    Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
    Output: 6
    Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.

    Follow up:
    If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and
    conquer approach, which is more subtle.
